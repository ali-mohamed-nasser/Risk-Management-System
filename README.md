### Introduction
In this project, we have studied and designed an automated system that monitors the videos coming from CCTV cameras. Cameras distributed in different areas of a particular city and analyze these videos using artificial intelligence models that we made by training them on such types of events in order to discover a group of events and classify them in order to be used in the second part of this system, which includes the appropriate and immediate response to these events, and this project joins many other projects that worked in the field of identifying human activities; This field is considered one of the most important research and applied fields within the computer vision, which aims to enable computers to perform one of the most important human capabilities, which is the understanding of various events in the videos and making the appropriate decisions that can provide a real solution to these events, but understanding the visual scenes in general it is considered the long-term goal of the field of computer vision, so all research and projects within this field at the present time focus on dealing with with specific tasks that constitute a step to reach the far goal, and perhaps the most important of these tasks is to classify, discover and track objects within these scenes in order to get to know the various activities and events, so we focus in the first section of our project on automatic identification of specific types of events, such as violence and fires, and then taking appropriate measures for the identified event such as sending fire vehicles or ambulances to the place of the event determined by the system automatically and giving the user of the system the ability to follow up the movement of these cars in real-time on an interactive map allows managing the movement in a smooth and simple way that ensures the achievement of the goal that aim of this project is to respond to important events that cause loss of life and infrastructure as soon as possible. In order to achieve this project to the fullest, we have used the latest technologies and tools available at the present time, which provide us with a balance between precision and performance.
